                        <h2>CUSTOM DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                        <p>Custom software development is the designing of
                            software applications for a specific user or group
                            of users within an organization.
                        </p>
                        <p>Such software is designed to address their needs
                            precisely as opposed to the more traditional and
                            widespread off-the-shelf software.
                        </p>
                        <p>Such software is typically created just for that
                            specific entity by a third-party by contract or
                            in-house group of developers and is not packaged for
                            reselling.
                        </p>
                        <h3>THE PROS OF CUSTOM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                        <p>The benefit to custom software is the simple fact it
                            provides features off-the-shelf software doesn’t.
                            Designing an application with your organization’s
                            needs in consideration implies an increased level of
                            productivity.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you have a software application designed to
                            increase productivity or address an internal need,
                            the cost of it is offset by the promise of increased
                            efficiency. If your organization has a need unique
                            enough to warrant for custom software, then
                            customizing a solution rather than settling for an
                            off-the-shelf application becomes a smart course of
                            action.</p>

                        <h3>THE CONS OF CUSTOM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                        <p>Whereas you can purchase an off-the-shelf software
                            application for dollars, customized software
                            requires significantly more resources to design and
                            thus comes with an inherently high amount of costs
                            and risks.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the end, cost alone can amount to the five-figure
                            range. Off-the-shelf software can afford a low price
                            point because the cost is being distributed between
                            many different users, whereas custom software is
                            created for one user: your company. The risks
                            associated with custom software vary in accordance
                            to the user being developed for.
                        </p>
                        <h3>CUSTOM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES</h3>
                        <p>Picking a company to create a software application
                            for your business isn't an easy task. Most small and
                            large businesses alike must search for local
                            companies to bid for work, and then pick the company
                            that promises the right price and level of services.
                            These companies typically meet with the requesting
                            organization to assess their needs and determine the
                            total amount of work required to create the custom
                            software.
                        </p>
                        <p>After that, they put in a bid to identify how much
                            development time is required and the cost
                            associated. These bids are never set in stone as
                            some projects may require additional time and may
                            thus cost more.
